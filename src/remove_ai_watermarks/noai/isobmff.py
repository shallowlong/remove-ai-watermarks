"""Minimal ISOBMFF box walker for stripping C2PA from AVIF / HEIF / MP4 / JPEG-XL.

The ISO Base Media File Format wraps content in nested ``[size:4][type:4][...]``
boxes. C2PA stores its manifest in a top-level ``uuid`` box keyed by the
C2PA UUID; JPEG-XL uses a ``jumb`` box (JUMBF) instead. To strip provenance
without re-encoding the image, we walk the top-level box list, drop boxes that
carry C2PA, and emit the rest verbatim. The codestream (``mdat`` for ISOBMFF,
``jxlc`` / ``jxlp`` for JPEG-XL) is untouched, so pixel data is preserved
bit-for-bit.

This file intentionally avoids dependencies on format-specific libraries
(pillow-heif, pillow-jxl, pymp4) so it works on systems where they aren't
installed.

Reference: ISO/IEC 14496-12 (ISOBMFF) and C2PA 2.1 spec §11.
